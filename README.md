# Various VBA analyses and tools

---

## Overview
A number of scripts used for analysing and processing data during the course of my duties as chemical engineering lecturer at Stellenbosch University. Examples of use cases:

- `MailMerge`: Converts e.g. a spreadsheet with personal details and marks for multiple students into individually formatted .pdf report for each student; example file included.
- `MakeFolders.bas`: Creates multiple subfolders with specified names in a selected folder.
- `ProcessMarks`: Used to capture marks for students from individual spreadsheet rubrics into a single main classlist, after performing some quality checks; example file included.
- `RenameMultipleFiles.bas`: Renames multiple files in a selected folder, given the current filenames and new filenames.
- `SaveWordAsPDF.bas`: Converts multiple MS Word documents in a specified folder to .pdf.
- `UpdateFormulas.bas`: Applies bulk formula changes to multiple cells across different tabs in the same spreadsheet.
