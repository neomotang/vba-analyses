# Various VBA analyses and tools

---

## Overview
A number of scripts used for analysing and processing data during the course of my duties as chemical engineering lecturer at Stellenbosch University. Examples of use cases:

- `MailMergeSaveFiles.bas`: Converts e.g. a spreadsheet with personal details and marks for multiple students into individually formatted pdf report for each student.
- `ProcessMarks.bas`: Used to capture marks for students from individual spreadsheet rubrics into a single main classlist, after performing some quality checks.
- `SaveWordAsPDF.bas`: Converts multiple MS Word documents in the specified folder to pdf.
- `UpdateFormulas.bas`: Applies bulk formula changes to multiple cells across different tabs in the same spreadsheet.
